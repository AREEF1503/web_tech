        <h2><u>Career as a scientist</u></h2>
      <p>After graduating from the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);"><b>Madras Institute of Technology</b></span> in 1960, Kalam joined the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);"><b>Aeronautical Development Establishment</b></span> of the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Defence Research and Development Organisation</span> (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);"> Defence Research & Development Service</span> (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">hovercraft</span>, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[27] Kalam joined the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">INCOSPAR</span>, working under <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Vikram Sarabhai</span>, the renowned space scientist. He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">H. G. S. Murthy</span>, the first Director of <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station</span> (TERLS). In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Indian Space Research Organisation</span> (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Rohini</span> satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.</p>

      <p>In 1963 to 1964, he visited <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">NASA'</span>s <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Langley Research Center</span> in <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility</span>. Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle</span> (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.</p>

      <p>In 1998, along with cardiologist <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Soma Raju</span>, Kalam developed a low cost <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">coronary stent</span>, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent". In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".</p>
