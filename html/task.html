      <h1>Super Robo Monkey Team</h1>
      <p>
        Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go![a] (also known as SRMTHFG or
        simply Super Robot Monkey Team) is an American-Japanese anime-influenced
        television series created by Ciro Nieli, one of the directors of Teen
        Titans, and the Showrunner and Executive Producer of Teenage Mutant
        Ninja Turtles.[3] It is produced by Walt Disney Television Animation,
        with animation being done by The Answer Studio in Japan.[2] The series
        was the first original show produced for the Jetix block and for the
        Jetix and Disney channels worldwide, where the show premiered on
        September 18, 2004.[1] It ran for four seasons composed of 52 episodes,
        each 22 minutes long.Set on the fictional planet of Shuggazoom, the
        series follows the adventures of five cyborg monkeys and a human boy
        named Chiro as they work to protect their planet – and the rest of the
        universe – from the forces of evil.The Super Robot Monkey Team is set in
        Shuggazoom City, a city that takes up a good portion of its planet,
        named Shuggazoom. The rest of the planet is divided into sparsely or
        entirely uninhabited zones. The largest of these making up the majority
        of the visible surface outside of Shuggazoom city is "The Zone of Wasted
        Years" which is a barren wasteland.The main character is a boy named
        Chiro. When he was exploring the outskirts of the city, he stumbled upon
        a giant abandoned robot partially overgrown with plants but still
        accessible. Once inside, his curiosity got the better of him and he
        pulls an old power switch among a series of stasis tanks. In doing so,
        he awakened the five robotic monkeys that form the Super Robot Monkey
        Team Hyperforce. In the process Chiro also fused himself with the
        mysterious supernatural energy of the Power Primate, allowing him to
        transform into a stronger, braver fighter and the leader of the team.
        With the aid of the five Robot Monkeys: Sparx, Antauri, Gibson, Otto and
        Nova, their mission is to save Shuggazoom City from the evil Skeleton
        King, the main villain of the series, as well as any other evil forces
        that may threaten it.Since Chiro was not born a superhero, or with any
        enhanced abilities, the five Robot Monkeys take up training him to hone
        his abilities which results in him leading the team. With each member
        possessing a different set of skills Chiro acts as a unifying force
        keeping them on point where they otherwise might fall to differing
        opinions, in addition to being familiar with the current culture of
        Shuggazoom. With the monkeys continuing to train Chiro he grows into the
        leader they need with the potential to fulfill his greater destiny as
        protector of the universe.When fighting with larger enemies the
        Hyperforce uses the Super Robot, which can operate as a single entity or
        split into six separate vehicles for versatility. Its main attack, when
        combined as the whole robot, is Lasertron Fury. This powerful energy
        beam that is fired from its chest is capable of destroying large objects
        or hostile entities while an array of smaller weaponry is used to handle
        other lesser threats. The Super Robot also serves as Chiro and the
        Monkeys' headquarters and home while parked on its landing pad in
        Shuggazoom City. Over the course of the series the history of both
        Shuggazoom and the Robot Monkeys is expanded upon revealing they were
        created long ago specifically to combat the evil Skeleton King by a
        brilliant inventor known only as the Alchemist. Having unintentionally
        released a great evil into the world with his experiments the Hyperforce
        was his attempt to prepare for an uncertain future where defenses would
        be needed. The Hyperforce itself also expanded as the series ran to
        include various allies and a rogues gallery of enemies as recurring
        characters.Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go! premiered on ABC
        Family's Jetix programming block on September 18, 2004.[26] It also
        aired on Toon Disney's Jetix block, until the Jetix programming block
        was taken off of ABC Family in August 2006, and the series began to air
        exclusively on Toon Disney. The show was planned to air on ABC Kids on
        September 17, 2005, but it was scrapped. It was shown on Jetix UK from
        January 1, 2005 until July 22, 2006. In 2005, Super Robot Monkey Team
        Hyperforce Go! aired on Champ TV in South Korea.[27] The entire series
        was broadcast in the United Kingdom on GMTV's Toonattik. In Ireland, it
        was released on RTÉ Two as part of "The Den" children's programming
        block. In 2007, the series was released on Mio TV in Singapore.The
        series was produced for widescreen, but originally shown cropped due to
        network restrictions.
