      <h2><u>Early life and education</u></h2>
      <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);"><strong>Tamil Muslim</strong></span> family in the pilgrimage centre of <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Rameswaram</span> on <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Pamban Island</span>, then in the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Madras Presidency</span> and now in the State of <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Tamil Nadu</span>. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque, his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Hindu pilgrims</span> back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);"><b><i>Dhanushkodi.</i></b></span>.</p>

      <p>Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);"><b>Marakayar</b></span> traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);"><b><i>Muslim</i></b></span> ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);"><b>Sri Lanka</b></span>, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);"><b>Pamban Bridge</b></span> to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.</p>

      <p>In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);"><b><i>Mathematics</i></b></span>. After completing his education at Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend the St. Joseph's College, <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);"><strong>Tiruchirappalli</strong></span> from where he graduated in Physics in 1954.</p>

      <p>Kalam moved to <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);"><b><i>Madras</i></b></span> in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);"><b><i>Madras Institute of Technology</i></b></span>. While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline." He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);"><b><em>IAF</em></b></span>.</p>

      <h2><u>Career as a scientist</u></h2>
      <p>After graduating from the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);"><b>Madras Institute of Technology</b></span> in 1960, Kalam joined the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);"><b>Aeronautical Development Establishment</b></span> of the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Defence Research and Development Organisation</span> (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);"> Defence Research & Development Service</span> (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">hovercraft</span>, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[27] Kalam joined the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">INCOSPAR</span>, working under <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Vikram Sarabhai</span>, the renowned space scientist. He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">H. G. S. Murthy</span>, the first Director of <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station</span> (TERLS). In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Indian Space Research Organisation</span> (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Rohini</span> satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.</p>

      <p>In 1963 to 1964, he visited <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">NASA'</span>s <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Langley Research Center</span> in <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility</span>. Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle</span> (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.</p>

      <p>In 1998, along with cardiologist <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Soma Raju</span>, Kalam developed a low cost <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">coronary stent</span>, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent". In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".</p>

    <h2><u>Religious and spiritual views</u></h2>
    <p>Religion and spirituality were very important to Kalam throughout his life. He made his own spiritual journey the subject of his final book, <span style="color:rgb(37, 113, 143);">Transcendence:<b><i>My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh Swamiji</i></b>.</span></p>
    <h4><u>Islam</u></h4>
    <p>Daily <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">namaz</span> and fasting during <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Ramadan</span> were integral to the life of Kalam, a practising Sunni Muslim. His father, <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">the imam of a mosque</span> in his hometown of Rameswaram, had strictly instilled these Islamic customs in his children.[10] His father had also impressed upon the young Kalam the value of interfaith respect and dialogue. As Kalam recalled: "Every evening, my father A. P. Jainulabdeen, an imam, Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry, the head priest of the Ramanathaswamy Hindu temple, and a church priest used to sit with hot tea and discuss the issues concerning the island." Such early exposure convinced Kalam that the answers to India's multitudinous issues lay in "dialogue and cooperation" among the country's religious, social, and political leaders. Moreover, since Kalam believed that "respect for other faiths" was one of the key cornerstones of Islam, he was fond of saying: "For great men, religion is a way of making friends; small people make religion a fighting tool."</p>
    <h4><u>Syncretism</u></h4>
    <p>One component of Kalam's widespread popularity among diverse groups in India, and an enduring aspect of his legacy, is the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">syncretism</span> embodied in appreciating various elements of the many spiritual and cultural traditions of India. In addition to his faith in the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Quran</span> and Islamic practice, Kalam was well-versed in Hindu traditions; he learnt <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Sanskrit</span>, read the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Bhagavad Gita</span> and he was a vegetarian. Kalam also enjoyed writing <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Tamil</span> poetry, playing the veena (an Indian string instrument), and listening to <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Carnatic devotional music</span> every day. In 2002, in one of his early speeches to Parliament after becoming president, he reiterated his desire for a more united India, stating that "during the last one year I met a number of spiritual leaders of all religions ... and I would like to endeavour to work for bringing about unity of minds among the divergent traditions of our country". Describing Kalam as a unifier of diverse traditions, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor stated, "Kalam was a complete Indian, an embodiment of the eclecticism of India's heritage of diversity". BJP leader L. K. Advani concurred that Kalam was "the best exemplar of the Idea of India, one who embodied the best of all the cultural and spiritual traditions that signify India's unity in immense diversity. This was most strikingly evident in the second-to-last book he published, presciently titled <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Transcendence:<b><i> My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh Swami.</i></b></p>
      <h4><u>Pramukh Swami as Guru</u></h4>
      <p>Kalam's desire to meet spiritual leaders to help create a more prosperous, spiritual, and unified India was what initially led him to meet <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Pramukh Swami</span>, the Hindu guru of the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">BAPS Swaminarayan Sampradaya</span>, who Kalam would come to consider his ultimate spiritual teacher and guru. The first of eight meetings between Kalam and Pramukh Swami over a fourteen-year period took place on 30 June 2001, in New Delhi, during which Kalam described being immediately drawn to Pramukh Swami's simplicity and spiritual purity. Kalam stated that he was inspired by Pramukh Swami throughout their numerous interactions. One such incident occurred the day following the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">terrorist attack on BAPS' Akshardham, Gandhinagar</span> complex in September 2002; Pramukh Swami prayed for, and sprinkled holy water upon, the sites of all of the deceased, including the terrorists, demonstrating the view that all human life is sacred. Kalam recalled being moved by Pramukh Swami's equanimity and compassion, citing this incident as one of his motivations for writing <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Transcendence:<b><i> My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh Swamiji</i></b></span>. Summarising the effect that Pramukh Swami had on him, Kalam stated that "[Pramukh Swami] has indeed transformed me. He is the ultimate stage of the spiritual ascent in my life ... Pramukh Swamiji has put me in a God-synchronous orbit. No manoeuvres are required any more, as I am placed in my final position in eternity." Following Kalam's death a month after his final book was released, co-author Arun Tiwari pointed to this passage as potentially prophetic and premonitory of Kalam's death.</p>

      <h2><u>Awards and honours</u></h2>
      <p>• Kalam received <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">7 honorary doctorates</span> from 40 universities. The Government of India honoured him with the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Padma Bhushan</span> in 1981 and the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Padma Vibhushan</span> in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government. In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Bharat Ratna</span>, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India. In 2008 Kalam was the recipient of <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Hoover Medal</span>. And in 2013, he was the recipient of the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Von Braun Award</span> from the National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project".</p>

      <p>• In 2012, Kalam was ranked number 2 in <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Outlook India's</span> poll of <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">the Greatest Indian.</span></p>

      <p>• Following his death, Kalam received numerous tributes. The <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Tamil Nadu</span> state government announced that his birthday, 15 October, would be observed across the state as "Youth Renaissance Day;" the state government further instituted the <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">"Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Award"</span>, constituting an 8-gram gold medal, a certificate and ₹500,000 (US$6,000). The award will be awarded annually on Independence Day, beginning in 2015, to residents of the state with achievements in promoting scientific growth, the humanities or the welfare of students.</p>

      <p>• On the anniversary of Kalam's birth in 2015 the  <span style="color:rgb(12, 65, 87);">CBSE</span> set topics on his name in the CBSE expression series.</p>

      <p>• Researchers at the NASA's <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</span> (JPL) had discovered a new bacterium on the filters of the International Space Station (ISS) and named it <span style="color:rgb(37, 112, 141);">Solibacillus kalamii</span> to honour the late president Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.</p>
